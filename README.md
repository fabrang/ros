Project Purpose:
This project simulates a scenario, where two cars drive towards a crossing.
The distances and velocitys are chosen on purpose that a crash occurs if no other action is executed.
Including sensors (laser range finder and usb-camera) publish their datas and the reaction time for
different sensors and their location is recorded. The goal is to create a dataset of different use-cases
including the different times.
